        description: `As a part of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)'s 70th Anniversary week-long Science and Technology Exhibition, Starzec Energy formerly McMendel Energy, in collaboration with the Student Representative Council (SRC) of KNUST, launched the KNUST Green Energy Challenge on May 13, 2022, at the Great Hall.
        The challenge is set to implement renewable energy and energy efficiency installations to replace the high cost of power generation in KNUST.
        The challenge affords students the opportunity to come up with ideas to move KNUST to NET ZERO. Net-zero is the equilibrium between greenhouse gas emissions and removal from the atmosphere. We attain net zero when the quantity added equals the amount subtracted.
        Mr Joseph Elikem Ametsitsi, an alumnus of KNUST and the CEO of Starzec Energy, revealed the challenge is open to students from all disciplines. Participants of the challenge, he said, must focus all their ideas on how to provide sustainable renewable energy sources and inventions for KNUST. Also, they must focus on issues of climate change, energy efficiency and being environmentally friendly.
        Mr Elikem Ametsitsi is a petroleum geologist working with the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and a strong advocate for energy transition, renewable energy provision, global warming and climate change.
        Other professionals at the launch were, Professor Francis Kemausour, Associate Professor in Renewable Energy Technology and Policy, Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, and Director of the Brew-Hammond Energy Center; Mr Kwadwo Poku, the CEO and Founder of FKP & RALD Investment LTD and Executive Director of INSTEPR who graced the occasion as the keynote speaker and Mr Makafui Mendelson, CEO of McMendel Group.
        
        The launch also saw the attendance of the KNUST Studentsâ€™ Representative Council, Members of the KNUST Faculty and some industry players. 
        
        The activities of the challenge begins on the 1st June, 2022 with the submission of abstracts on the ideas and innovations through to 2nd September which is staled to be the final or climax of the event.
